TaskZen is web application project designed to streamline task management for individuals or teams. Leveraging the power of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

The front-end development utilizes React.js, a powerful JavaScript library, to create dynamic and interactive components that enhance the user experience. The app's UI is enhanced by utilizing Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) for styling.
